# List Example
list = [10,20,30,40,50]         #list is mutable means we can not change values
list.append(60)
print(list)
list.insert(6,70)
print(list)
list.insert(2,29)
print(list)
list.remove(29)
print(list)

# Tuple  Example
# tuple is immutable ,Tuple means that we can not change the valuse of tuple
tup = (10,20,30,40)
print(tup)
print(tup[2])

#Set
#It is a collection of elements.The Set never follows the sequence 

set ={10,20,30,40,50}
print(set)
